### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m Marty, currently in last semester of my Mphys in physics with astrophysics degree at University of Bath.
- ðŸŒ± My final year project was about deriving non-separable Hamiltonian variational integrators from first principles. It was mostly a theoretical project, with a small simulation element to it, applying the derived integration schemes to different Hamiltonian systems for testing. Hopefully I get around to cleaning up my code and make the repo for it public soon.
