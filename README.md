### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m Marty, recently graduated Master in Physics with Astrophysics with a 2.1, currently working as a middle office specialist in an algorithmic crypto trading firm.
- ðŸŒ± My final year project was about deriving non-separable Hamiltonian variational integrators from first principles. It was mostly a theoretical project, with a small simulation element to it, applying the derived integration schemes to different Hamiltonian systems for testing. Find the repo for it on my page.
